        <h1 class="">ArcGIS Dashboards</h2>
          <p>The first solution Team.13 explored was ArcGIS Dashboards. Although initially promising, the team eventually decided to pivot to the more powerful ArcGIS Experience Builder.</p>
        <div class="col-md-5">
          <img src="images/Dashboard.JPG" class="rounded screenshot" alt="City of Beaumont Tree Dashboard">
          <p class="caption">City of Beaumont Tree Inventory Dashboard.</p>        
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-7">
          <p>ArcGIS Dashboards offer a quick and simple way to visualize data in an interactive way. The core of the dashboard is the map which displays the data. For our project, we needed a solution that would display the current tree inventory of the City of Beaumont and provide some information about what is being displayed on the map.</p>
          <p>The fastest way to achieve this was to create a simple map in ArcGIS Pro that contained the tree feature class. The map was then published to ArcGIS Online as a web map that is used as the main map in the Dashboard. The total number of trees, species, and amount of each species in the current extent is displayed and updates as the user zooms and pans around the city. </p>
          <p>Dashboards are quick and simple but also lack advanced functionality. For example, the user does not have a way of filtering or only selecting a certain species of tree. Charting of many different species (as in the case of Beaumont) becomes challenging to display effectively on one chart. A cap on the maximum number of categories to be displayed on the chart had to be implemented or it would become too crowded and not legible. In the end, we decided that ArcGIS Dashboards lacked the amount of functionality that would be needed in our project scope.</p>
          <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Dashboards are simple and quickly display data.</li>
            <li>Lack the functionality of other products such as Experience Builder</li>
            <li>Primarily for viewing data.</li>

        <p>ArcGIS Experience Builder allows the user to create powerful web applications using data from ArcGIS Online. Through connecting to the web map and using the default widgets, the product is a versatile web application that allows the user to interact with the data for their own intended use.

                <p>From our first two iterations it was clear that Experience Builder was going to be used in the final solution. The ability to interact with the map through the default widgets was simple to integrate. However at this point in time the web application was lacking the specified views for Tree Inventory, Neighborhoods, and a Service Request. The widgets were not modified in any way to allow the user to filter by tree species or change the chart.</p>

                <p>Through our contact at Beaumont we obtained the current tree inventory and the city’s base data (neighborhoods, parks, trails, lakes, streets and city boundary). With updated data, the team ran the same calculation to simulate canopy.</p>
                <p>It was during this iteration that the full functionality of Experience Builder, with relation to our proposed solution, was realized. The web application was sectioned into the three views (Tree Inventory, Neighborhoods/Parks, and the Service Request. </p>
                <p>However, this iteration was also limited in that the calculation of canopy cover in the Neighborhoods/ Parks view was not always accurate. It was believed that acquiring the area of the map extent would require a customized widget, as such the calculation of canopy cover uses the area of the neighborhood. This makes the calculation accurate if only one neighborhood is in the extent, otherwise it will always take the area of the first neighborhood in the list widget.  </p>

          <p>The Story Map can be configured as a continuously scrolling web page that can logically tell the story of your topic. For our project, the City of Beaumont would like to use a Story Map as a means of communicating their Urban Forest Management Strategy (UFMS) to the public.</p>
          <p>In addition to including facts and information from Beaumont's UFMS, we wanted to provide the public with an interactive way of visualizing the cities current tree inventory. To accomplish this, a 3D Web Scene was created in ArcGIS Scene Viewer that includes City base data, as well as the Tree Inventory.</p>
          <p>To improve the visual appearance of the scene, the trees were styled appropriately to represent 3D trees with heights taken from the height field of the data. This gives a more realistic appearance, and the user can easily distinguish younger trees from more mature trees throughout the city. Our aim is to style the trees more realistically according to species as well including views that highlight specific parks that would benefit from additional tree coverage.</p>
