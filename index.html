      <h1>The Problem</h1>
      <p>The City of Beaumont, Alberta, has spoken to Team.13 about making data on their urban canopy more accessible to the public, to improve engagement and interest with their urban forest management goals. The problem statement below details Team.13's assessment of the issue, and planned deliverable. The following pages provide more information on the team, a discussion on the options the team explored in tackling this problem, and finally demonstrate the solution the team landed on to meet the City of Beaumont's needs.</p>
      <h2>Ideal</h2>
      <p>Beaumont city residents can view the current trees and canopy coverage within their city and see how Beaumont compares to other Canadian cities. </p>
      <h2>Reality</h2>
      <p>The city of Beaumont currently has no way for residents to engage with or understand information regarding the city's urban forest.</p>
      <h2>Consequences</h2>
      <p>If the solution is not accomplished the public will not have a sense of the current status of Beaumont's urban forest, or the possibilities for improving forest coverage.</p>
      <h2>Proposal</h2>
      <p> An interactive dashboard where the public can view the trees in the the city and their approximate canopy coverage. The dashboard will be supplemented with a story map that highlights parks and streets that could benefit from better coverage. Additionally, the dashboard will feature an integrated survey that allows city residents to submit service requests for particular trees in the city.</p>
      <h2>Technology Explored</h2>
      <p>ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Dashboard/Experience Builder, ArcGIS Story Map</p>
